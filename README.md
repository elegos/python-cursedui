This is a python graphic library based on the curses library.

It hides the complexity of the basic library and offers a class-first approach to UI.

You can run the example files simply by running `python [filename].py`

## Available tiles

### [Split](cursedui/tiles/split.py)

Equally vertically splits the available space between its child tiles.


```python
from cursedui import Split

splitTile = Split(tile1, tile2, ...)
```

### [Text](cursedui/tiles/text.py)

Shows the string subject in the available canvas. `offsetX` and `offsetY` attributes allow to move the pane of the visible text.

Invalid offset values will be reset either to 0 (if offset &lt; 0) or to the calculated maximum offset (if offset &gt; maximum offset).

```python
from cursedui import Text

textSubject = Subject('myText')
splitTile = Text(title='My title', bordered=True, subject=textSubject)

splitTile.offsetY = 27 # might default to the maximum possible offset
splitTile.offsetX = -1 # defaults to 0
```

### [Log](cursedui/tiles/log.py)

Derived from `Text`. The key difference is the auto-scroll feature, which disables itself whenever the vertical offset (`offsetY`) is not aligned with the last line of the subject (i.e. when manual offset control is used).

```python
from cursedui import Log

logSubject = Subject('Log line 0')
splitTile = Log(title='My scrolling log', bordered=True, subject=logSubject)

for i in range(100):
  logSubject(f'{logSubject.value}\nLog line {i}')
```

### [ProgressBar](cursedui/tiles/progressBar.py)

A progress bar shows the progression of an action. It can be configured to show or not the absolute numbers on the left side of the bar.

The tile accepts the following custom parameters:
- `total` (int, required): represents the 100%.
- `showNumbers` (bool, optional, default `True`): show the absolute numbers on the left of the progress bar.

The subject (int) represents the current progression (absolute number, relative to `total`). If the number exceedes `total`, total will be shown.

```python
from cursedui import ProgressBar

progression = Subject(0)
progressBarTile = ProgressBar(title='My progression', total=127, bordered=True, subject=progression, showNumbers=true)

for i in range(100):
  progression(i)
```

## Extending (creating new tiles)

The library is made to be easily enhanced with new tiles.

To create a new tile, you need to extend the `cursedui.Tile` class and implement its abstract `render` method.

See the [tile.py](cursedui/tile.py) file to see the rest of the overrideable methods.

See [tiles](cursedui/tiles) folder for a list of tiles available out-of-the-box.

Other than the `render` method, you might want to override the following methods:

- `Tile.onBeforeWindowRefresh` - used to access the curses' window (it should be used for particular cases only). See the [Split tile](cursedui/tiles/split.py) for an example.
- `Tile.shouldRender` - which should be overwritten returning the super's result and the new tile's particular logic. See the [Text tile](cursedui/tiles/text.py) for an example.

```python
from typing import List

from cursedui import Tile, Subject


class Dumb(Tile[str]):
    def render(self, canvas: Canvas) -> None:
        lines = [self.subject * canvas.width for _ in range(canvas.height)]
        canvas.lines = lines

        return canvas
```
## Tile decorators
Tile decorators allow to extend their graphical representation without adding complexity to the normal usage. All the available decorators are written in the [tile_decorators.py](cursedui/tile_decorators.py) file.

### fixed_height
Allows to define a fixed height tile, rather than following the mainstram logic to split the view equally between tiles.

It will attempt to get the required vertical space, but it will be limited to the main UI's available space. Also notice that this might preclude other views to show (for example if the remaining available space is not sufficient to show the remaining tiles).

Currently only the main UI class ([CursedUI](cursedui/cursedui.py)) supports this decorator.

```python
from cursedui import Text
from cursedui.tile_decorators import fixed_height

myTile = fixed_height(maxHeight=20)(Text(...))
```

### fixed_width
Allows to define a fixed width tile (absolute, percentage), rather than following the mainstream logic (CursedUI: full width; Split: equally divided).

It wil lattempt to get the required horizontal space, but it will be limited to the available width. Also notice that if misused, this might prevent other tiles to be shown.

- [Split](cursedui/tiles/split.py)
